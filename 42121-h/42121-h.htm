<p>"Mr. Robb is better known probably as
'Solitaire,' under which name he has written
some very broad, farcical sketches of Western
manners for the <i>Reveille</i>, of St. Louis. Some
of the sketches in this volume are spirited
and cleverly written, and they are all lively
and full of animal spirits; but they are too
brief to contain a development of character.
The best sketch is the story of 'Old Sugar,'
which is illustrated by an exceedingly fine
drawing by Darley. We feel, after inspecting
the designs in this book, that we have heretofore
underrated the comic powers of this
admirable artist; there are evidences in some
of these designs of a very high order of genius."&mdash;<i>N.

<b>WIDOW RUGBY'S HUSBAND</b>,<br />
AND OTHER STORIES.<br />
By JOHNSON J. HOOPER, Esq.<br />
<i>Author of "Adventures of Captain Simon<br />
Suggs."</i></p>

<p class="center">WITH ILLUSTRATIONS BY ELLIOTT.</p>

<p>"A collection of humorous stories well calculated
to provoke laughter. We advise the
immediate purchase of the book, but a temperate
use of it&mdash;one story at a sitting will
be sufficient; a greater indulgence might
result seriously. The very pictures have
set us in a roar, and we can scarce compose
our nerves sufficiently to make our words
intelligible to the compositor."&mdash;<i>Philada.
Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>"This is, of course, quite full of fun&mdash;'all
sorts' of fun; and those who want a good
laugh, should take a peep at Elliot's very
original comic illustrations."&mdash;<i>Am. Courier.</i></p>

<p>"This book is by the favorite and witty
author of 'Adventures of Simon Suggs,' with
original designs by the inimitable Darley.
It is a capital illustration of the laughable
side of Western and Southern life. If you
would enjoy a broad laugh, buy it."&mdash;<i>City
Item.</i></p>

<p>"There is enough 'fun' in this volume to
'spice' a magazine for a twelvemonth."&mdash;<i>Southern
Literary Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"Excellent for dispelling care are the humorous
works with which Mr. A. Hart, Chestnut
and Fourth streets, is supplying the
lovers of mirth. His is the only 'library' of
the kind in the country, where genuine humor
is measured out in periodical doses, and
always warranted to make a man 'laugh
and grow fat.' That is the motto, and a
capital one it is. The last lot is labelled
'Widow Rugby's Husband,' divided into a
number of the most comical and amusing
stories imaginable. The illustrations of 'A
Ride with Old Kit,' 'A Night at the Ugly
Man's,' 'Captain McFadden,' and the 'Poor
Joke,' are among the richest provocatives to
a hearty laugh."&mdash;<i>American Courier.</i></p>

OR, SKETCHES OF SOUTHERN LIFE AND ADVENTURE.<br />
BY JOS. B. COBB.</p>

<p>"The peculiar manners and odd customs,
the curious ways, and still more curious people
who reside, live, or float on the great
river, are passed in review, and pleasant
stories are told about them."&mdash;<i>Boston Evening
Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"The stories are well told, and some of
the sketches of character are well drawn."&mdash;<i>Savannah
News.</i></p>

<p>"We have here a neat volume of sketches
by one of the contributors of the Gazette; a
gentleman of fine abilities and finished education,
who resides in Mississippi. The present
volume is confined entirely to scenes of
Southern Life, all of which are told with
spirit and naturalness."&mdash;<i>Saturday Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"This is a pleasant book, and interesting
from the circumstance of the sketches, as the
author tells us in his preface, being chiefly
drawn from real scenes and characters, illustrative
of life in Mississippi; and, happily,
for the most part, not the low comic life affected
by so many of the recent painters of
Southern manners and adventures."&mdash;<i>North
American.</i></p>

<p>"The sketches before us are full of captivating
and amusing incidents; and to the
Mississippi reader, they are peculiarly interesting,
from the fact that many of the
'Scenes' are laid within the borders of our
own State. To all who would enjoy an entertaining
volume, we commend this work."&mdash;<i>The
Mississippian.</i></p>

<p>"A graphic description of the peculiarities
of people in a new country, in which curious
relations are blended with satire and broad
humour, cannot fail to amuse. Such is the
character of this agreeable volume."&mdash;<i>Baltimore

in its way, and full to overflowing with
curious and absorbing events. Those who
read the first chapter will not lay it down
until the story is mastered entire."&mdash;<i>City
Item.</i></p>

<p>"A well-written story of adventure, bordering
somewhat on the marvellous, but an
agreeable and interesting book."&mdash;<i>Savannah
News.</i></p>

<p>"This is a well-written book, by an author
from whom we hope to hear again. It is full
of incident and adventure, while Maberry
himself is exceedingly well drawn."&mdash;<i>Saturday

<p class="center">LORD BACON'S WORKS.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Price Reduced to $7 50.</b><br />
In 3 Royal 8vo. Volumes, Cloth Gilt.</p>

<p class="center"><b>THE WORKS OF LORD BACON</b>,<br />
WITH A MEMOIR, AND A TRANSLATION
OF HIS LATIN WRITINGS,</p>

<p class="center">BY BASIL MONTAGU, ESQ.</p>

<p class="center">In Three Volumes, Octavo.</p>

<p>The American edition of the works of
Lord Bacon now offered to the public, is
reprinted from the most approved English
edition, that of Basil Montagu, Esq., which
has recently issued from the celebrated
press of Pickering, (the modern Aldus.) in
seventeen octavo volumes. It contains the
complete works of the illustrious philosopher,
<i>those in Latin being translated into
English</i>. In order to render the publication
cheap, and therefore attainable by all
our public and social libraries, as well as
by those general readers who study economy,
the seventeen octavo volumes have
been comprised in three volumes, imperial
octavo. Being printed from the most accurate
as well as complete English edition,
and carefully revised, the American edition
will possess greater advantages for the critical
scholar as well as the general reader.
In typography, paper and binding, it will
be recognized as a brilliant specimen of
the products of the American book trade.</p>

<p>"We may safely affirm, that, by giving
the Inductive Philosophy to the world,
Lord Bacon has proved one of its most signal
benefactors, and has largely done his
part towards promoting the final triumph
of all truth, whether natural, or moral and
intellectual, over all error; and towards
bringing on that glorious crisis, destined,
we doubt not, one day to arrive, when, according
to the allegorical representation of
that great poet, who was not only the Admirer
of Bacon, but in some respects his
kindred genius&mdash;<span class="smcap">Truth</span>, though 'hewn like
the mangled body of Osiris, into a thousand
pieces, and scattered to the four winds,
shall be gathered limb to limb, and moulded,
with every joint and member, into an
immortal feature of loveliness and perfection.'"</p>

<p>"We are more gratified than we can
find words to express, to find a publishing
house in this country, putting forth a publication
like the Complete Works of Lord
Bacon, in a form at once compact, elegant
and economical."&mdash;<i>Brother Jonathan.</i></p>

<b>THE WAVERLEY NOVELS</b>,<br />
<span class="smcap">By</span> SIR WALTER SCOTT,<br />
<i>With all the Author's latest Notes and Additions,
Complete, without the slightest
Abridgment.</i></p>

<p class="center">In Five Royal 8vo. volumes, upwards of
650 Pages in each volume.</p>

<p class="center">CONTENTS.</p>

<p>Waverley, Guy Mannering, Antiquary,
Rob Roy, Black Dwarf, Old Mortality,
Heart of Mid-Lothian, Bride of Lammermoor,
Legend of Montrose, Ivanhoe, The
Monastery, The Abbot, Kenilworth, The
Pirate, Fortunes of Nigel, Peveril of the
Peak, Quentin Durward, St. Ronan's Well,
Redgauntlet, The Betrothed, The Talisman,
Woodstock, The Highland Widow, Two
Drovers, My Aunt Margaret's Mirror,
Tapestried Chamber, The Laird's Jock,
Fair Maid of Perth. Anne of Geierstein,
Count Robert of Paris, Castle Dangerous,
The Surgeon's Daughter.</p>

<p>The object of the publishers in thus reducing
the price of the Waverley Novels,
is to endeavor to give them a greatly extended
circulation, and they have, therefore,
put them at a price which brings them
within the reach of every family in the
country. There is <i>now</i> no fireside that
need be without a set of the most charming
works of fiction ever issued from the press:
for there is no one that can't afford two
dollars and a half&mdash;TWO DOLLARS
AND A HALF for twenty-five of Sir Walter
Scott's Novels! ten cents for a complete
Novel!! ten cents for "Ivanhoe,"
which was originally published at a guinea
and a half!!! It seems impossible, and yet
it is true. In no other way can the same
amount of amusement and instruction be
obtained for ten times the money, for the
Waverley Novels alone form a Library.</p>

<p>The publishers wish it to be distinctly
understood, that, while the price is so greatly
reduced the work is in no way abridged,
but is <span class="smcap">carefully printed from, and contains
every word in the last Edinburgh
Edition</span>, in forty-eight volumes, which sells
for seventy-two dollars.</p>

<p>Now is the time to buy! Such an opportunity
may never again occur. Let every
one, then, who wants the <i>Waverley Novels
for two dollars and a half, now purchase</i>, for
if the publishers do not find the sale greatly
increased, by the immense reduction in
price, they will resume the old price of
twenty-five cents for each Novel, which
<i>was</i> considered wonderfully cheap.</p>

<p class="center">THE<br />
<span class="big"><i>Prose Writers of Germany.</i></span><br />
BY F. H. HEDGE.<br />
ILLUSTRATED WITH PORTRAITS.</p>

<p>The work mentioned above comprises a
list of the most eminent writers of Germany,
together with copious extracts from their
works, beginning with <span class="smcap">Luther</span> and reaching
up to the present time. For those who are
interested in the literature of Germany, it
presents a valuable aid in becoming more
intimately acquainted with the German
mind; and even to the curious it offers an
excitement which will grow stronger in proportion
as their taste is cultivated.</p>

<p>In the present volume we find valuable extracts,
given from their prose writings. Although
the writers follow in chronological
order, and <span class="smcap">Luther</span> stands at the head of his intellectual
brethren, the longest space is allowed
to those who claim our greatest attention;
and <span class="smcap">Goethe</span> therefore occupies the most conspicuous
position both in the specimens given
and the selection of the pieces. <span class="smcap">Goethe</span> is a
writer who requires most of all to be studied;
while others, as <span class="smcap">Schiller</span>, in his passionate
mood and ideal longings, requires no silent
and incessant reflection, because he works
his effects immediately by rousing the depth
of our nature. Next to <span class="smcap">Goethe</span>, <span class="smcap">Schiller</span>
appears in an article upon Naïve and Sentimental
Poetry, a bold effort of him, the success
of which is however yet very disputed,
to classify every produce of Art according to
the impressions made upon the reader, and
to dispense with the various and cumbersome
forms of the departments into which
we have been accustomed hitherto to arrange
all subjects bearing upon poetry. The
department upon which <span class="smcap">Schiller</span> enters
here, belongs properly to the philosophy of
Art; to the aesthetics, the investigation of
the beautiful.</p>

<p>Foremost stands <span class="smcap">Lessing</span>, the first critic of
his time. Next to him comes <span class="smcap">Herder</span>, a devout
philosopher, and a clear-sighted intellect,
with the eyes of a child; curious to
penetrate the maze and noisy market of the
world, the variegated life among the ancients
and the moderns in search for that beautiful
humanity which he had sketched in his own
mind, and which he would fain proclaim the
order of an otherwise mysterious providence.
The two brothers <span class="smcap">Schlegel</span>&mdash;William, the
noble interpreter and translator of Shakspeare,
and Frederic, known best by his investigations
of the language and wisdom of
the Indians&mdash;follow him, and <span class="smcap">Moses Mendelssohn</span>,
a Jewish philosopher, closes the
series of these writers. The treatise of the
latter on the Sublime and Naïve will be read
with interest by everybody who has only an
ordinary reading of ancient and modern
poetry. Distinct from all the rest stand <span class="smcap">Wieland</span>
and <span class="smcap">Jean Paul Richter</span>, best known
in this country by the appellation, of <span class="smcap">Jean
Paul</span>.</p>

<p class="center">RECENTLY PUBLISHED,<br />
IN TWO VOLUMES, POST 8VO., WITH PORTRAITS, CLOTH, EXTRA GILT, $2.<br />
MEMOIRS OF THE<br />
<b class="big">COURT OF MARIE ANTOINETTE,</b><br />
(QUEEN OF FRANCE.)<br />
BY MADAME CAMPAN.<br />
First Lady of the Bed-chamber to the Queen.<br />
With a Biographical Introduction from "The Heroic Women of the
French Revolution."<br />
BY M. DE LAMARTINE.</p>


<p class="center">OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</p>

<p>"The book is a noble defence of Marie Antoinette
against the many calumnies breathed
against her. Moreover, as a picture of manners
during the latter years of Louis XV.,
and the entire reign of his successor, it has
no superior; it is at once more decent and
more veracious than the 'Life of Dubarry,'
and the thousand other garbled memoirs of
that period. A large number of notes, explanatory
and otherwise, accompany the
volume, and add materially to its value.
Mr. Hart has published the book in a style
of great elegance, and illustrated it with
portraits, on steel, of Marie Antoinette and
Madame Elizabeth. It is a book that should
find a place on every lady's centre-table."&mdash;<i>Neal's
Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"Two very interesting volumes, which the
reader will not be likely to leave till he has
finished them."&mdash;<i>Public Ledger.</i></p>

<p>"The material of this history could not
have emanated from a more authentic or official
source, nor have been honoured with a
more distinguished or capable god-father
than De Lamartine."&mdash;<i>Saturday Courier.</i></p>

<p>"These elegant volumes are a reprint from
the third London edition of this very delightful
work. The vicissitudes depicted in the
volumes, and scarcely less the charming
style of the author and the entire familiarity
of her theme, make the work one of the most
interesting that has recently issued from the
American press, and no less instructive and
entertaining."&mdash;<i>N. Y. Commercial Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>"This delightful work, abounding with
historical incidents connected with one of the
most stirring periods of French history, presents
the reader with the personal annals of
one of the most amiable and excellent women
that ever shared the honours of royalty.
Compiled by one every way competent by
talent and education, and qualified by personal
familiarity, the facts are entitled to the
confidence of the reader, while the style is
piquant and graceful. The work is got up
in a very superior style of mechanical execution."&mdash;<i>Baltimore
Sun.</i></p>

<p>"We have seldom perused so entertaining
a work&mdash;it is as a mirror of the most splendid
court of Europe, at a time when monarchy
had not been shorn of any of its beams, that
it is particularly worthy of our attention."&mdash;<i>Morning
Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>"There is not a page of the work which is
not deeply or amusingly interesting. The
position of the author at the court of Louis
XVI. gave her extraordinary opportunities
for looking behind the scenes for the causes
of much that was entirely inexplicable to
the public. Indeed, there can be no question
of her knowledge, while of her truthfulness,
as far as she goes, there is abundant
evidence in the volumes themselves. We
cannot believe Marie Antoinette to have
been as immaculate as she is painted by
Madame Campan. Young, giddy, inexperienced
and wilful, she was cast headlong into
the most profligate court of Christendom.
Surrounded by pleasures and temptations,
amid a set of beings to whom gallantry was
so habitual that it ceased to be remarked&mdash;with
an impotent husband, and with all
around him corrupt, venal, and licentious,
we cannot believe that all the scandalous
stories respecting the queen were entirely
without foundation, that she was <i>always</i>
misconstrued and maligned."&mdash;<i>Boston Morning
Post.</i></p>

The great success that has attended the publication of<br />

Comprising the Critical and Miscellaneous Writings of the Most Distinguished Authors
of Modern Times, has induced the publishers to issue a New, Revised and very Cheap
Edition, with Finely Engraved Portraits of the Authors; and while they have <i>added</i> to
the series the writings of several distinguished authors, they have reduced the price more

<p>"It may now be asked by some sapient
critics, Why make all this coil about a mere
periodical essayist? Of what possible concern
is it to anybody, whether Mr. Thomas
Babington Macaulay be, or be not, overrun
with faults, since he is nothing more than
one of the three-day immortals who contribute
flashy and 'taking' articles to a Quarterly
Review? What great work has he
written? Such questions as these might be
put by the same men who place the Spectator,
Tattler and Rambler among the British
classics yet judge of the size of a cotemporary's
mind by that of his book, and who
can hardly recognize amplitude of comprehension,
unless it be spread over the six
hundred pages of octavos and quartos.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>&mdash;Such
men would place Bancroft above Webster,
and Sparks above Calhoun, Adams, and
Everett&mdash;deny a posterity for Bryant's Thanatopsis,
and predict longevity to Pollok's
Course of Time. It is singular that the sagacity
which can detect thought only in a
state of dilution, is not sadly graveled when
it thinks of the sententious aphorisms which
have survived whole libraries of folios, and
the little songs which have outrun, in the
race of fame, so many enormous epics.&mdash;While
it can easily be demonstrated that
Macaulay's writings contain a hundred-fold
more matter and thought, than an equal
number of volumes taken from what are
called, <i>par eminence</i>, the 'British Essayists,'
it is not broaching any literary heresy
to predict, that they will sail as far down
the stream of time, as those eminent members
of the illustrious family of British classics."</p>

characteristic that it would be difficult to

FRANCIS LORD JEFFREY.</p>

<p class="center"><i>In One Volume 8vo., with a Portrait.</i></p>

<p>From a very able article in the North
British Review we extract the following:</p>

<p>"It is a book not to be read only&mdash;but
studied&mdash;it is a vast repository; or rather
a system or institute, embracing the whole
circle of letters&mdash;if we except the exact
sciences&mdash;and contains within itself, not in
a desultory form, but in a well digested
scheme, more original conceptions, bold
and fearless speculation and just reasoning
on all kinds and varieties of subjects than
are to be found in any English writer with
whom we are acquainted within the present
or the last generation. ... His
choice of words is unbounded and his felicity
of expression, to the most impalpable
shade of discrimination, almost miraculous.
Playful, lively, and full of illustration, no
subject is so dull or so dry that he cannot
invest it with interest, and none so trifling
that it cannot acquire dignity or elegance
from his pencil. Independently however,
of mere style, and apart from the great
variety of subjects embraced by his pen,
the distinguishing feature of his writings,
and that in which he excels his cotemporary
reviewers, is the deep vein of practical
thought which runs throughout them all."</p>

<p class="center"><i>Illustrated by the best artists.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>In one volume octavo, uniform, with Carey &amp;
Hart's illustrated Bryant, Willis, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The following exquisitely finished line engravings
are from original designs, by our
most celebrated painters, and are executed in
the highest style of art:&mdash;Portrait of the Authoress;
Hope; A Child playing with a
Watch; The Reaper; Ida; Old Friends; The
Child's Portrait; Little Red Riding Hood;
The Life Boat; Twilight Hours; The Arab
and his Steed; Zuleika.</p>

<p>"There is nothing mechanical about her;
all is buoyant, overflowing, irrepressible vivacity,
like the bubbling up of a natural
fountain. In her almost childish playfulness,
she reminds us of that exquisite creation
of Fouque, Undine, who knew no law
but that of her own waywardness. The great
charm of her poetry is its unaffected simplicity.
It is the transparent simplicity of truth,
reflecting the feeling of the moment like a
mirror."&mdash;<i>Rev. Dr. Davidson.</i></p>

<p>"In all the poems of Mrs. Osgood, we find
occasion to admire the author as well as the
works. Her spontaneous and instinctive effusions
appear, in a higher degree than any
others in our literature, to combine the rarest
and highest capacities in art with the sincerest
and deepest sentiments and the noblest aspirations.
They would convince us, if the
beauty of her life were otherwise unknown,
that Mrs. Osgood is one of the loveliest characters
in the histories of literature or society."&mdash;<i>Pennsylvania
Inquirer and Courier.</i></p>

<p>"The position of Mrs. Osgood, as a graceful
and womanly poetess, is fixed, and will be
enduring. To taste of faultless delicacy, a
remarkable command of poetical language,
great variety of cadence, and a most musical
versification, she has added recently the highest
qualities of inspiration, imagination, and
passion, in a degree rarely equalled in the
productions of women.... The reputation
which Mrs. Osgood enjoys, as one of the most
amiable, true-hearted, and brilliant ladies in
American society, will add to the good fortune
of a book, the intrinsic excellence and
beauty of which will secure for it a place
among the standard creations of female genius."&mdash;<i>Home

OF THE<br />
EMPRESS JOSEPHINE</b>,<br />
(Marie Rose Tascher de la Pagerie,)<br />
FIRST WIFE OF NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.<br />
BY MLLE. M. A. LE NORMAND.<br />
<i>Translated from the French by Jacob M.
Howard, Esq.</i></p>

<p>In 2 vols., 700 pages, muslin extra gilt.</p>

<p>"It possesses great intrinsic interest. It
is a chequered exhibition of the <i>undress life</i>
of Napoleon. All the glitter and pomp and
dust of glory which bewilder the mind is
laid; and we behold not the hero, the emperor,
the guide and moulder of destiny,
but a poor sickly child and creature of circumstance&mdash;affrighted
by shadows and tortured
by straws."&mdash;<i>Philada. City Item.</i></p>

<p>"This is one of the most interesting works
of the day, containing a multiplicity of incidents
in the life of Josephine and her renowned
husband, which have never before
been in print."&mdash;<i>N. O. Times.</i></p>

<p>"This is a work of high and commanding
interest, and derives great additional value
from the fact asserted by the authoress, that
the greater portion of it was written by the
empress herself. It has a vast amount of
information on the subject of Napoleon's
career, with copies of original documents
not to be found elsewhere, and with copious
notes at the end of the work."&mdash;<i>N. O. Com.
Bulletin</i>.</p>

<p>"Affords the reader a clearer insight into
the private character of Napoleon than he
can obtain through any other source."&mdash;<i>Baltimore
American.</i></p>

<p>"They are agreeably and well written;
and it would be strange if it were not so,
enjoying as Josephine did, familiar colloquial
intercourse with the most distinguished
men and minds of the age. The work
does not, apparently, suffer by translation."&mdash;<i>Baltimore
Patriot.</i></p>

<p>"It is the history&mdash;in part the secret history,
written by her own hand with rare
elegance and force, and at times with surpassing
pathos&mdash;of the remarkable woman
who, by the greatness of her spirit was worthy
to be the wife of the soaring Napoleon.
It combines all the value of authentic history
with the absorbing interest of an autobiography
or exciting romance."&mdash;<i>Item.</i></p>

<p>"The author of this work&mdash;for it is well
entitled to the name of an original production,
though mainly consisting of translations&mdash;Frederick
H. Hedge of Bangor, is
qualified, as few men are in this country,
or wherever the English language is written,
for the successful accomplishment of
the great literary enterprise to which he has
devoted his leisure for several years.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hedge has displayed great wisdom
in the selection of the pieces to be translated;
he has given the best specimens of
the best authors, so far as was possible in
his limited space.</p>

<p>"We venture to say that there cannot be
crowded into the same compass a more
faithful representation of the German mind,
or a richer exhibition of the profound
thought, subtle speculation, massive learning
and genial temper, that characterize the
most eminent literary men of that nation."&mdash;<i>Harbinger.</i></p>

<p>"What excellent matter we here have.
The choicest gems of exuberant fancy, the
most polished productions of scholarship,
the richest flow of the heart, the deepest

<p class="center"><b>NAPOLEON<br />
AND<br />
THE MARSHALS OF THE EMPIRE.</b></p>

<p class="center">Complete in 2 vols. 12mo.,<br />
<i>With 16 Steel Portraits in Military Costume</i>.</p>

<p class="center">Contents.</p>

<p>Napoleon, Jourdan, Serrurier, Lannes,
Brune, Perignon, Oudinot, Soult, Davoust,
Massena, Murat, Mortier, Ney, Poniatowski,
Grouchy, Bessieres, Berthier, Souchet,
St. Cyr, Victor, Moncey, Marmont, Macdonald,
Bernadotte, Augereau, Lefebvre,
Kellermann.</p>

<p>The biographies are twenty-seven in
number&mdash;Napoleon and his twenty-six
marshals, being all those created by him&mdash;and
therefore these pages have a completeness
about them which no other work of a
similar design possesses.</p>

<p>The style is clear and comprehensive,
and the book may be relied upon for historical
accuracy, as the materials have been
drawn from sources the most authentic.
The Conversations of Napoleon, with Montholon,
Gourgaud, Las Cases and Dr. O'Meara
have all been consulted as the true
basis upon which the lives of Napoleon
and his commanders under him should be
founded.</p>

<p>"The article on Napoleon, which occupies
the greater part of the first volume, is
written in a clear and forcible style and
displays marked ability in the author. Particular
attention has been paid to the early
portion of Napoleon's life, which other writers
have hurriedly dispatched as though
they were impatient to arrive at the opening
glories of his great career."&mdash;<i>N. Y. Mirror.</i></p>

<p>"The lives of the Marshals and their
Chief, the military paladins of the gorgeous
modern romance of the 'Empire,' are given
with historic accuracy and without exaggeration
of fact, style or language."&mdash;<i>Baltimore
Patriot.</i></p>

<p>"We have long been convinced that the
character of Napoleon would never receive
'even handed justice' until some impartial
and intelligent American should undertake
the task of weighing his merits and demerits.
In the present volume this has been
done with great judgment. We do not
know the author of the paper on Napoleon,
but whoever he may he, allow us to say to
him that he has executed his duty <i>better than
any predecessor</i>."&mdash;<i>Evening Bulletin.</i></p>

<p>"The style of this work is worthy of commendation&mdash;plain,
pleasing and narrative,
the proper style of history and biography
in which the reader does not seek fancy
sketches, and dashing vivid pictures, but
what the work professes to contain, biographies.
We commend this as a valuable
library book worthy of preservation as a
work of reference, after having been read."&mdash;<i>Balt.
American.</i></p>

<p>"This is the clearest, most concise, and
most interesting life of Napoleon and his
marshals which has yet been given to the
public. The arrangement is judicious and
the charm of the narrative continues unbroken
to the end."&mdash;<i>City Item.</i></p>

<p>"The publishers have spared no pains or
expense in its production, and the best talent
in the country has been engaged on its various
histories. The style is plain and graphic,
and the reader feels that he is perusing
true history rather than the ramblings of a
romantic mind."&mdash;<i>Lady's Book.</i></p>

<p>"The result of these joint labors is a series
of narratives, in which the events succeed
each other so rapidly, and are of so marvelous
a cast, as to require only the method in
arrangement and the good taste in description
which they have received from the
hands of their authors. The inflated and
the Ossianic have been happily avoided."&mdash;<i>Colonization
Herald.</i></p>

<p>"Their historical accuracy is unimpeachable,
and many of them (the biographies)
are stamped with originality of thought and
opinion. The engravings are numerous and
very fine. The book is well printed on fine
white paper, and substantially bound. It
deserves a place in all family and school
libraries."&mdash;<i>Bulletin.</i></p>

<p>"It abounds in graphic narratives of battles,
anecdotes of the world-famed actors,
and valuable historical information."&mdash;<i>Richmond
Inquirer.</i></p>

<p>"We receive, therefore, with real pleasure,
this new publication, having assurance
that great pains have been taken in the preparation
of each individual biography, and
especially in collating the various authorities
upon the early history of the Emperor.
There appears to be nowhere any attempt
to blind the reader by dazzling epithets, and
the accuracy of construction throughout is
highly creditable to the editor."&mdash;<i>Commercial
Advertiser N. Y.</i></p>

<p>"The style is simplicity itself, wholly free
from the amusing pomposity and absurd inflation
that distinguish some of the works
which have gone before it."</p>

<p class="center">PETER SCHLEMIHL.</p>

<p class="center big">PETER SCHLEMIHL IN AMERICA.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Complete in One Volume, 12mo.</i></p>

<p>"The object of this work is to 'catch the
manners living as they rise' in connection
with the antagonisms of the present day&mdash;'<i>novelties
which disturb the peace</i>'&mdash;as Swedenborgianism,
Transcendentalism, Fourierism,
and other <i>isms</i>. The author has
made these pages the vehicle of valuable
information on all the topics of which he
has treated.</p>

<p>"Peter, as our readers may recollect, sold
his shadow to a Gentleman in Black, and
upon this fable the American adventures
are founded. The author, whoever he may
be, has read much, and been at least 'a
looker on in Venice,' if not a participator
of the follies of fashionable life.</p>

<p>"The theological and political criticism
is inwoven with a tale of fashionable life,
and the reader becomes not a little interested
in the heroine, Mrs Smith, who certainly
must have been a remarkable woman. It
is neatly published, and will be extensively
read."&mdash;<i>Bulletin.</i></p>

<p>"We shall be greatly mistaken if this
book does not kick up a whole cloud of
dust."&mdash;<i>The City Item.</i></p>

<p>"The work is characterized by much
learning and sincere feeling."&mdash;<i>N. Y. Mirror.</i></p>

<p>"One of the most entertaining works we
have read for many a day, as well as one
of the best written. Who the author is we
know not; but we do know that the book
will meet with a rapid sale wherever an
inkling of its character leaks out. For
watering places, or anywhere, during the
hot weather, it is worth its weight in&mdash;gold
we almost said. It is full of everything of
the best, and you can scarcely open it at
random without striking upon some sketch
or dialogue to enchain the attention."&mdash;<i>Germantown
Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>"His stock of knowledge is large; and as
his conscience is rectified by Christian
principle, and his heart beats in unison
with the right and the true, he uses his treasures
of information only for good purposes.</p>

<p>"The book belongs to that class of <i>novels</i>
which make an interesting story the medium
for the communication of important
truth. In many respects it is a peculiar
work, differing from all others in both design
and execution, and leaving the impression
that it is the product of a mind of no
ordinary power. ...</p>

<p>"Those who love to <i>think</i> and <i>feel</i>, as the
result of truthful thought, will read the book
with interest and profit."&mdash;<i>Reflector &amp; Watchman.</i></p>

<p>"A rare book. Who in the world wrote
it? Here are nearly five hundred pages
with gems on every one of them. The
satire is equal to that of Don Quixote or
Asmodeus. The hits at society in this
country are admirable and well pointed.
The humbugs of the day are skillfully
shown up, and the morals of the book are
unexceptionable. The author cannot long
escape detection, in spite of his shadowy
concealment, and if a new practitioner he
will jump to the head of his profession at
once."&mdash;<i>Godey's Lady's Book.</i></p>

<p>"We are prepared to say, that Peter
Schlemihl is an exceedingly clear and
well-written work&mdash;that the author has
displayed a considerable amount of book
lore in its composition&mdash;that the story is interesting
and instructive&mdash;that we have
been entertained and edified by its perusal,
and that it possesses merits of more than
ordinary character. We cordially recommend
it to the reading community, since we
are sure that they will be benefitted as well
as entertained by the revelations contained
in the pages of Peter."&mdash;<i>The National Era.</i></p>

<p>"A strangely conceived and ably executed
work."&mdash;<i>N. O. Com. Times.</i></p>

<p>"The work forms a consecutive tale, all
along which runs a vein of severe satire,
and which at every step is illustrated by a
vast deal of valuable information, and the
inculcation of sound principles of morality
and religion. It is a work which is adapted
to do good, suited to all intelligent general
readers, and a pleasant companion for the
scholar's leisure hours."&mdash;<i>N. Y. Recorder.</i></p>

<p>"This is a very remarkable production,
and unless we are greatly deceived, it is
from a new hand at the literary forge. We
have read every page of this thick volume,
and have been strongly reminded of Southey's
great book, <i>The Doctor</i>. The author of
this work must be a man of close observation,
much research, and if we are accurate
in our estimate, he is a layman. ...
This same book will make a sensation in
many quarters, and will unquestionably
create a name and reputation for its author,
who forthwith takes his place among the
best and keenest writers of our country. ...
We commend it to the <i>gravest</i> and <i>gayest</i> of
our readers, and assure them that our own
copy will not go off our table until another
winter has passed away."&mdash;<i>N. Y. Alliance
and Visitor.</i></p>

<p>"The volume cannot fail to be read extensively
and do good. The popular '<i>isms</i>' of
the day, their folly and injurious tendency,
are descanted upon with mingled gravity
and humor, and considerable talent and
truthful feeling are shown in the discussion.
Whether the book have an immediate
<i>run</i> or not, the soundness of its views, delivered
with some quaintness of style, will
insure it permanent popularity."&mdash;<i>N. York
Commercial Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>"Light, sportive, graceful raillery, expressed
with terse and delicate ease. ...</p>

<p>"It is a novel of fun, with grave notes by
way of ballast."&mdash;<i>Christian Examiner.</i></p>

<p class="center">Now ready, in 1 vol. post 8vo., price $1 25, with Portraits,<br />
<span class="big">WASHINGTON AND THE GENERALS OF
THE REVOLUTION.</span></p>

<p class="center">BY VARIOUS EMINENT AUTHORS.</p>

<p class="center">CONTAINING</p>

<p class="center"><b><i>Biographical Sketches of all the Major and Brigadier Generals
who acted under commissions from Congress during
the Revolutionary War.</i></b></p>

<p>We hail these beautiful volumes with
undisguised delight. They supply, in a dignified
and comprehensive form, valuable
information, which will be sought with avidity,
not only by the American public, but
by the world at large. The want of a work
of <i>positive authority</i> on this subject has long
been felt and deplored. The enterprise and
good taste of Messrs. Carey and Hart have
given us two handsome and reliable volumes,
betraying industry and talent, and
replete with facts of the deepest interest.
There is no idle romancing&mdash;no school-boy
attempts at rhetorical display; on the contrary,
the work is written in a clear, unaffected,
business-like, yet beautiful manner.
The authors had the good sense to
think that the stirring events of "the times
that tried men's souls," needed no embellishment.
It is a complete, impartial, and well
written history of the American Revolution,
and, at the same time, a faithful biography
of the most distinguished actors in
that great struggle, whose memories are
enshrined in our hearts. The typographical
execution of the work is excellent, and the
sixteen portraits on steel are remarkably
well done. The first volume is embellished
with a life-like portrait of Washington
mounted on his charger, from Sully's
picture, "<i>Quelling the Whisky Riots</i>." This
is, we believe, the first engraving taken
from it. There are biographies of <i>eighty-eight
Generals</i>, beginning with "the Father
of his country," and closing with General
Maxwell. To accomplish this task, we
are assured that "the accessible published
and unpublished memoirs, correspondence,
and other materials relating to the period,
have been carefully examined and faithfully
reflected." We earnestly commend
this work. It will be found an unerring
record of the most interesting portion of
our history.&mdash;<i>The City Item.</i></p>

<p>This work differs from Mr. Headley's,
having nearly the same title, in many important
particulars; and <i>as an historical book
is much superior</i>.&mdash;<i>N. Y. Com. Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>Certainly the most comprehensive and
individualized work that has ever been
published on the subject&mdash;each member of
the great <i>dramatis personæ</i> of the Revolutionary
tragedy, standing out in bold and
"sculptured" relief on his own glorious
deeds.&mdash;<i>Saturday Courier.</i></p>

<p>This work is very different affair from
the flashy and superficial book of the Rev.
J. T. Headley entitled "Washington and
the Generals." It appears without the
name of any author, because it is the joint
production of many of the most eminent
writers in the country, resident in various
states in the Union, and having, from the
circumstance, access to original materials
in private hands, and to public archives not
accessible to any one individual without
long journey and much consumption of
time. The result, however, is a complete
and authentic work, embracing biographical
notices of every one of the Revolutionary
Generals. The amount of fresh and original
matter thus brought together in these
moderate-sized volumes, is not less surprising
than it is gratifying to the historical
reader. This will become a standard book
of reference, and will maintain its place in
libraries long after the present generation
shall have enjoyed the gratification of perusing
its interesting pages, exhibiting in a
lively style the personal adventures and
private characters of the sturdy defenders
of American Independence.&mdash;<i>Scott's Weekly
Newspaper.</i></p>

<p>The author's name is not given, and from
what we have read, we presume that various
pens have been employed in these interesting
biographies. This is no disadvantage,
but, on the contrary, a decided benefit,
for it insures greater accuracy than could be
looked for in such a series of biographies
written by one person in a few months.
The volumes are published in a very handsome
style. The first sixty pages are occupied
with the biography of Washington,
which is written with force and elegance,
and illustrated by an original view of the
character of that great man.... The
number of the biographies in these volumes
is much greater than that of Mr. Headley's
work. There are eighty-eight distinct subjects.&mdash;<i>N.
Y. Mirror.</i></p>

<p>We have read a number of the articles,
find them to be written with ability, and to
possess a deep interest. The author has
manifested excellent judgment in avoiding
all ambitious attempts at what is styled
<i>fine writing</i>; but gives a connected recital
of the important events in the lives of his
heroes. The work will be highly interesting
and valuable to all readers&mdash;particularly
so to youth, who are always attracted
by biographies. If a father wishes to present
to his sons noble instances of uncorrupted
and incorruptible patriotism, let him
place this work in their hands. It should
have a place in every American library,
and is among the most valuable books of the
season.&mdash;<i>Baltimore American.</i></p>

<p>"The materials of which these volumes

generosity, the various genius, which have
made Hamilton the name of statesmanship

of John Marshall, unsusceptible of error,
whose capacity to see the truth was equalled
only by his power of compelling others to
receive it; in the light of whose logic opinions
appeared to assume the nature of
facts, and truth acquires the palpableness
of a material reality; the bluntness, force
and probity of Pickering; the sterling excellences
of Wolcott himself, who had no

BY MRS. FORBES BUSH.</p>

<p class="center">FROM THE SECOND LONDON EDITION.</p>

<p class="center"><i>In Two Volumes 12mo., with Portraits, $2.</i></p>

<p>"Mrs. Forbes Bush is a graceful writer,
and in the work before us has selected the
prominent features in the lives of the Queens
with a great deal of judgement and discrimination.
These memoirs will be found not
only peculiarly interesting, but also instructive,
as throwing considerable light
upon the manners and customs of past
ages."&mdash;<i>Western Continent.</i></p>

<p>"We have looked over the lives of some of
the Queens, presented in Mr. A. Hart's new
volumes, with great interest. While none
are devoid of some degree of attraction, the
most of them have a charm about their person
or character exceeding any thing we find
in the most popular romances. They are full
of sentiment and romance, rendered all the
more touching from the graceful drapery in
which they are adorned, and by the truthfulness
of which the reader is strongly impressed.
It is of course doubly attractive,
in reading the strongly marked characters
of history, to feel a conviction of the truth,
with which ever the wildest and most thrilling
incidents are invested. The Lives of
these fair ladies are full of instruction, a
merit that mere romance seldom possesses.
The Author, Mrs. Forbes Bush, commences
with Queen Basine, in the reign of Childeric

commencement of the Christian era. The
volumes close with the late Queen of the

<p>"For this beautiful volume, the student
and practitioner of Surgery will feel grateful
to the ability and industry of Prof. Pancoast.
The drawing and execution of the
plates are splendid examples of American
art, and do credit to Messrs. Cichowski
and Duval, while the description is no less
creditable to the author. We have examined
the book with care, and feel great
pleasure in declaring that, in our opinion,
it is a most valuable addition to the surgical
literature of the United States. It was a
happy idea to illustrate this department of
surgery, as it renders perfectly clear what
the very best verbal description often
leaves obscure, and is, to some extent, a
substitute for witnessing operations. To
those practitioners especially, who are
called upon occasionally, only, to perform
operations, we are not acquainted with any
volume better calculated for reference prior
to using the knife. There are similar
works published in Europe, but they are
much more expensive, without being superior
in point of usefulness to the very cheap
volume before us.</p>

<p>"All the modern operations for the cure
of squinting, club-foot, and the replacing
lost parts and repairing deformities from
partial destruction of the nose, &amp;c., are very
clearly explained and prettily illustrated.
It is questionable whether anything on this
subject can be better adapted to its purpose,
than Pancoast's Operative Surgery."&mdash;<i>Saturday

<p>"We do not possess a modern work on
Dental Surgery, written by a British Author,
which equals that of Dr. Goddard.&mdash;One
reason for this may arise from the circumstance,
that the learned author is a
practical anatomist, whose knowledge is
on a level with the modern discoveries,
and who has himself authenticated the
latest researches into the minute anatomy
of the dental structure. It is quite apparent
that such knowledge must prove of immense
value in enabling any one to arrive
at just conclusions relative to the diseases
of the teeth; and it is chiefly to be attributed
to the want of such knowledge that most
writers on Dental Surgery have erred so
much relative to the causes and nature of
these diseases. The work may confidently
be recommended, as containing the <i>best and
most approved methods of performing all
the operations connected with Dental Surgery</i>.</p>

<p>"This truly great work of M. Ricord, who
is an American and a native, we believe, of
Baltimore, though now the eminent hospital
surgeon of Paris, has long been a desideratum
in the English language. The immense expense
of its publication, and especially the
cost of the richly coloured engravings, which
are an indispensable accompaniment of the
text, has hitherto deterred publishers at home
and abroad from its issue. The profession
are largely indebted to Dr. Betton, the translator,
and Dr. Goddard, who has prepared the
work for the press, as also the enterprising
publisher, who has brought out this magnificent
book, in royal quarto, with its multiplied
illustrations, in a style of excellence as
respects typography, engraving, and colouring,
which will do honour to American art.
Of the value of this work it is unnecessary to
say more than that it is and must continue
to be a standard authority on a most important

the patronage of the whole profession,
for placing within the reach of all this noble

<span class="big"><b>AMERICAN COTTON SPINNER,</b></span><br />
AND<br />
MANAGERS' AND CARDERS' GUIDE:<br />
A PRACTICAL TREATISE ON COTTON SPINNING.<br />
Compiled from the Papers of the late Robert H. Baird.<br />
In One Volume, Cloth Gilt, Price $1.</p>

<p>"This is a practical age, and it demands
practical books. Of this class is the manual
before us, addressing itself to a rapidly growing
interest among us, and one, upon the
prosperity of which depends, in a great measure,
the destiny of the South. We have too
long committed the fatal error of allowing
Northern manufactories to convert our staple
into the fabrics we require for use, losing by
the process all the expenses of a double transportation,
the profits of manufacturing, and
sundry incidental costs of interest and exchange.
With the increasing attention to
manufactures in the South, arises the need
of information upon all their appliances and
workings, and much that is valuable of this
nature is found in the book before us. Mr.
Baird was an expert and successful cotton-spinner.
His experience and observations
are here afforded to his fellow-operatives,
combined with the modern improvements in
mechanics and methods. No intelligent man
at the present day builds without 'counting
the cost,' or enters upon a field of labour
without a comprehensive knowledge of its
capabilities and requirements. To those
proposing to erect small factories, or now
conducting them, the treatise before us could
not fail to be of service, if well studied, and
to such we commend it."&mdash;<i>Southern Literary
Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"Had we space we might go on to state a
number of other equally interesting and important
facts. The work from which much
of the foregoing is taken, is published by Mr.
A. Hart, and was compiled chiefly from the
papers of the late Robert H. Baird, well
known as an expert cotton-spinner. It is
gratifying to see that so respectable a house
as that of Mr. Hart has undertaken the publication
of books of this kind, for we believe
that our operatives should possess a theoretical
as well as practical knowledge of their
several trades. This work gives the dimensions
and speed of machinery, draught and
twist calculations, with notices of the most
recent improvements. It must prove an invaluable
hand-book to the manufacturer."&mdash;<i>Germantown
Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>"As the treatise now stands, it is a most
complete and practical guide in the spinning
of cotton. It gives the dimensions and speed
of machinery, draught and twist calculations;
together with rules and examples for
making changes in the size and number of
roving yarn. The work will be found of
value, equally by operatives and mill-owners.
It is issued in a very neat style."&mdash;<i>Arthur's
Home Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"'The American Cotton Spinner and Managers'

on cotton-spinning, giving the dimensions

calculations, &amp;c., with notices of recent improvements,
together with rules and examples
for making changes in the size of
roving and yarn. This work is compiled
from papers of the late Robert H. Baird, well
known as an expert cotton-spinner, and will
prove of great service to cotton-growers, mill-owners,
and cotton-spinners. This book will
undoubtedly meet with an extensive sale in
the South, where attention is beginning to
be turned in earnest to manufacturing as
well as growing cotton."&mdash;<i>Drawing-room

are thoroughly explained. Buildings,
main gearing, water-wheels, picking
and spreading machines, cards and carding,
drawing-frames, speeders, throstles and mule
spinning, are elaborately discussed, and to
those engaged in the production of cotton
goods, the volume must be exceedingly useful.
To political economists and others, who
feel an interest in the great progress of our
country, the historical and statistical portions
of the book will also be of value.</p>

<p>"'In 1770, there were exported to Liverpool
from New York three bags of cotton
wool; from Virginia and Maryland, four
bags; and from North Carolina, three barrels.
Last year England paid $71,984,616 to
the United States for raw cotton, which sum
is exclusive of that paid to other cotton-growing
nations. In 1790 the first cotton-mill
was erected in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. In
1850 the number of spindles in operation
was computed at 2,500,000.' These facts are
among the most signal evidences of the unexampled
progress and prosperity of the
country, and cannot be considered without
emotions of pride and gratification."&mdash;<i>N. Y.
Commercial Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>"It is compiled from the papers of the late
Robert H. Baird, well known as an expert
cotton-spinner, and forms a practical treatise
relative to spinning in all its departments
and relations, the dimensions and speed of
machinery, draught and twist calculations,
&amp;c. &amp;c., which cannot but commend itself to
the favourable attention of all connected
with this important manufacturing interest."&mdash;<i>North

<p>"The moulding of iron for useful purposes
is one of the most extensive pursuits of society.
Nevertheless, there are comparatively
few works which present a clear, intelligible,
and simple statement of the branches of this
art, so as to be readily understood by all.
The present work seems to supply this deficiency."&mdash;<i>Scientific
American.</i></p>

<p>"This volume is prepared on the same
plan as that on Cotton Spinning, and has a
number of wood-engravings. It must prove
invaluable to the iron master. It is certainly
a book that has long been needed, and we
know that it will be extensively circulated."&mdash;<i>Germantown
Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>"The 'Moulders and Founder's Pocket

PRICE $1.</p>

<p>The Year-Book of Facts in Science and
Art, exhibiting the most important discoveries
and improvements of the past year,

over it, one is surprised at the progress making
in these branches, and in order to keep
up with the age, such a book as this is absolutely
necessary."&mdash;<i>Evening Bulletin.</i></p>

<p>"Such a volume commends itself sufficiently
to public favour by its title. The
importance of possessing it is apparent at a
glance, since the knowledge of a single one
of these facts, or new discoveries in science
and the useful arts, may very possibly be
worth in cash to the buyer ten times the
price of the book."&mdash;<i>Scott's Weekly.</i></p>

<p>"The 'Year-Book of Facts' is another of
Mr. Hart's excellent publications. It is a
reprint from the London edition, and exhibits
the most important discoveries and

few spare moments present themselves,
which might otherwise be unimproved."&mdash;<i>Boston
